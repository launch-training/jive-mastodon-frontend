## Dependencies
### antd 
Ant Design is a comprehensive UI component library based on React. Components can be used as they are provided or customized using the [theme-editor](https://ant.design/theme-editor)

### react-router-dom 
React Router DOM is a routing library for React applications. It enables navigation between different components and views within an application, allowing us to create single-page applications with dynamic routing and nested views.

We are using the CreateBrowserRouter and RouterProvider, so that we might use the Data APIs later on. [Read more about react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/routers/picking-a-router)

### react-toastify 
React Toastify is a library for displaying customizable toast notifications. It provides an easy way to show alerts, success messages, warnings, and other notifications to users.
A demo to see which configurations might be nice can be found [here](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/introduction/)
